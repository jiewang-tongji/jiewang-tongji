## About Me
I graduated with my Ph.D. in Computer Engineering, under the supervision of Dr. [Wenye Wang](https://www.ece.ncsu.edu/people/wwang/) from [North Carolina State University](https://www.ncsu.edu/), in Oct. 2019. I received my M.S. and B.S. in Electrical Engineering from Tongji University, Shanghai, China, in 2010 and 2013 respectively.


## Research Interests
My research interests lie in the area of networking, including modeling and performance evaluation of networked systems (e.g., Internet-of-Things, cyber-physical systems, and social networks), dynamic spectrum access, information assurance, mobile/edge computing, and mobile big data.
